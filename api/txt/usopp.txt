"God" Usopp is the sniper of the Straw Hat Pirates and the former captain of the Usopp Pirates. He was born in Syrup Village and was first mentioned by Yasopp, his father. Despite his normal cowardice, Usopp dreams of becoming a brave warrior of the sea just like his father and lives every day in pursuit of living up to this dream.

He was officially the third (unofficially fourth) member of the crew, and the third to join, and, including Nami and Robin, also the third to rejoin, doing so at the end of the Post-Enies Lobby Arc. His original bounty of 30,000,000 Beli was credited to his alias and alter-ego "Sogeking".

During the events in Dressrosa, Usopp awakened his Kenbunshoku Haki, making him the fourth member of the Straw Hat crew to demonstrate and use a form of Haki. His current bounty, 200,000,000 Beli, is a huge jump from his original, due to his role as "God" for saving all the toy slaves in Doflamingo's underground trades. This took him from the third lowest bounty of the crew to the third highest, jumping past the previous holder, Nico Robin, which has since dropped to fifth place after the events of the Whole Cake Island Arc.
